# Installation Guide 
## ViviBoom Admin Panel
This guide walks you through setting up the development environment for the ViviBoom admin panel.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) which includes npm by default.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://<repository_url>.git
    ```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd viviboom-admin
    ```
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
1. Start development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start-dev
    ```
 **Note -** If you encounter an error during this step, you have two options:
    1. Update the `start-dev` script in package.json
        - From:
            ```json
            "start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3029 NODE_ENV=development react-scripts start"
            ```
        - To:
            ```json
            "start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3029 NODE_ENV=development react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
            ```
    1. [Downgrade Node.js to version 14](https://github.com/VIVIBOOMOpenSource/VIVIBOOMOpenSource/blob/main/nodejs-downgrade.md).
1. Access the frontend:
    - Local: http://localhost:3029/
